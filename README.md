About this repository and usage
By opening dev tools via the Inspect command on your browser, you will see within the HTML file a keen attention to semantic usage.  Our goals in the deploying of this website were both to acheive superb accessibility to those users with disabilities, and to maximize seach optimization for the user.  This project has sought to streamline its accessibility to provide the user with the most direct path to utilizing the services provided here.  At the top of the page, there is a navigation bar with the topics covered in the site, and by clicking these the user is directed to the coinciding content below.  In the refactoring of the CSS file, we sought to consolodate classes to make the file more concise to make future editing as clean as possible.  During the course of this project, our team learned how semantic tags can improve accessibility to both users and developers while not neccesarily changing the visual effects of the final website.  Below I have linked screenshots of our deployed site.
